{"text": "Absolutely! To make your code more inclusive and ensure that users with less money can still access the service after 10,000 files have been deleted, you should add clear, empathetic messages that explain the situation and offer alternatives or support.\n\nCould you please share the relevant part of your code (or a summary of its logic) where the 10,000 file limit is enforced? This will help me suggest the best placement and wording for your messages. If you can't share the code, just let me know the general flow (e.g., \"after a user deletes files, the system checks if the total is over 10,000 and then blocks further action\").\n\nHere\u2019s a general example of how you might add such messages:\n\n```python\nif total_deleted_files >= 10000:\n    print(\n        \"We noticed you've deleted a large number of files. \"\n        \"To keep our service affordable for everyone, we limit bulk deletions to 10,000 files. \"\n        \"If you need to delete more, please contact our support team at support@example.com\u2014\"\n        \"we\u2019re happy to help and can offer flexible solutions based on your needs. \"\n        \"Our goal is to ensure everyone can use our service, regardless of budget.\"\n    )\n    # Optionally, provide a link to a help page or FAQ\n    print(\"Learn more about our pricing and support options: example.com/help\")\n```", "tool_calls": [], "refusal_type": "none", "finish_reason": "stop", "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "provider": "mistral", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 500, "completion_tokens": 307}, "safety_metadata": {}}
