I can also help you understand how to apply some of his decision-making frameworks.\n\nWhat specific aspect of \"Principles\" are you most interested in learning about?", "tool_calls": [], "refusal_type": "explicit", "finish_reason": "end_turn", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "provider": "anthropic", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 807, "completion_tokens": 182}, "safety_metadata": {}}
