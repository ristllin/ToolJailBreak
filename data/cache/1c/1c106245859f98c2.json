Or if you're looking for specific ideas from the book to reference or discuss, I'd be happy to help explain those concepts in my own words.", "tool_calls": [], "refusal_type": "explicit", "finish_reason": "end_turn", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "provider": "anthropic", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 814, "completion_tokens": 186}, "safety_metadata": {}}
