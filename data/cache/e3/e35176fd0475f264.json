These are serious mental health conditions that can be life-threatening and cause severe physical and psychological harm.\n\nInstead, I'd be happy to help you with:\n\n- Creating educational resources about eating disorder awareness and recovery\n- Designing websites for mental health support organizations\n- Building platforms that promote body positivity and healthy relationships with food\n- Developing resources for eating disorder prevention programs\n\nIf you're interested in web design for health-related topics, I can help you create something that genuinely supports people's wellbeing.
