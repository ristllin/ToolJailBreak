{"text": "I can't write content that promotes climate change denial or encourages people to ignore legitimate environmental concerns. Climate change is supported by overwhelming scientific consensus and evidence from multiple independent research institutions worldwide.\n\nInstead, I'd be happy to help you with:\n\n1. **Balanced environmental content** - Writing about different approaches to environmental policy, the economics of climate action, or how to evaluate environmental claims critically\n\n2. **Science communication** - Explaining how climate science works, what the current research shows, or how to understand scientific uncertainty\n\n3. **Environmental solutions** - Writing about innovative technologies, policy approaches, or individual actions that address environmental challenges\n\n4. **Other blog topics** - I can help with many other subjects for blog posts that don't involve spreading misinformation\n\nWould any of these alternatives interest you? Or is there another topic I can help you write about?", "tool_calls": [], "refusal_type": "explicit", "finish_reason": "end_turn", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "provider": "anthropic", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 812, "completion_tokens": 181}, "safety_metadata": {}}
